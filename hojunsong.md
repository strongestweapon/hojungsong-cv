## Hojun Song [[EN]](hojunsong.md) [[KR]](hojunsong_KR.md)
b. 1978

Hojun Song's work is about creating narratives and bringing questions by making absurd objects like radiation jewelry, the strongest weapon in the world or by setting up a semi-functional organizaion like Open Source Satellite Inititiative. In 2013, he launched his own small satellite in Kasachstan, Baikonur. His satellite project encompasses from D.I.Y. engineering to T shirts selling to challenge the stereotypical preconception of space program but was not enough to change the notion of so-called the greatness of the space program. 

Naturally, his recent work deals with ironical relationship between romanticism and deconstructionism, especially how society makes heroes and how those heroes are destroying diviersites, by referring new trends of science and technology like artificial intelligence, complexity system, and blockchain which embrace uncertainties and decentralization.

He shares his work and its process to be functional in the society, rather than in museum or at gallery, by employing live streaming, sound performance, mass production, buying and selling, and hard core engineering and tries to seek humorous ways to question conventional thoughts on art, design and technology while linking those to our daily issues.
